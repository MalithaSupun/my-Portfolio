                    When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on Twitter or on Indie Hackers, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. Follow me on Twitter @supun_malitha where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can connect with me on GitHub to see my web pharmacy project and explore my passion for learning new technologies and languages.
